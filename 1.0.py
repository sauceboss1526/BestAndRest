Alexis Lafraniere of the New York Rangers regarded as a "bust" over the open internet... mainly on X.
A bust is a player drafted first overall and spends majority of his career playing outside of the NHL (change wording). 
 First overall pick data will be gathered from NHL statistics websites via BeautifulSoup to compare first overall NHL picks 

 Two datasets will be joined via player name:

 Rookiesdata -->  list of rookies amd their respective draft information.
